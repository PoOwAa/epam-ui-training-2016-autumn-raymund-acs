Polling - Automatically update topic lists

4.1 - Add a new event called newTopicsFound to BaseStorage. This event will notify its listeners if new topic are found in server.
    - Create a new abstract method in BaseStorage called startCheckingNewTopics. This method starts the listening to the server for the new topic.
    
    function BaseStorage() {
        this.newTopicsFound = new Event();
    }
  
    BaseStorage.prototype.startCheckingNewTopics = function () { };
 
4.2 Implement the startCheckingNewTopics() method in AjaxStorage:
     - In every 5 sec load all topic from the server: 
       For repeated timing use setInterval(functionToExecute, periodInMillisec);
       For loading all topic use getAllTopics("")
     - Check if the number of topic are increased?  
     - If yes then raise the newTopicFound event so it will notify its subscribers
     - Store the last number of topic in a field in the storage.
  
4.3 Uncomment the following two line in topicController to enable automatic topic list refreshing.

    Storage.startCheckingNewTopics();
    Storage.newTopicsFound.subscribe(fetchTopics);
