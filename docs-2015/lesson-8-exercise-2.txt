To modify:
  - ajax-storage.js
      getAllTopics:
        get request to /forum/topics
        data: searchString (a parameter)
        use the THEN handler after the call
        the handler is called with a parameter that will contain an array
        call the deserializeTopic private function for each item and add these to a result array
For the extra:
  - topic-controller.js
      fetchTopics method
        b; modify the code to use done and fail callbacks instead of then
        a; modify the second handler in the then call
      you can test this by modifying the getAllTopics method in ajax-storage.js to call a different url (e.g.: /forum/notexists)
