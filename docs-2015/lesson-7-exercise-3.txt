Implement toast view behaviour

- open toast-view.js
- expand the module's body to publish (return) the two following methods:
      show
	  hide
	  
- show: a function with a message, a class type and the success handler
- it must show the toast with the given style and message, with a fade in effect, and when the effect is done, it must call the success handler

- hide: a function with a success handler
- it must hide the toast with a fadeout effect and once done, it must call the success handler
