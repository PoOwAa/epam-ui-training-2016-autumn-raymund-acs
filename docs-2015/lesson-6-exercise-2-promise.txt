Deferred - Use promises in storage

2.1 Currently the methods of MemoryStorage have callback parameters to notify us when the operation is done.
    Modify them to use promises instead of callbacks!
     - createTopic(topic, done) -> createTopic(topic).then(done);
     - getAllTopics(searchString, done) -> getAllTopics(searchString).then(done);

    Use the jQuery Deferred API.
    var deferred = $.Deferred(): creates a deferred
    deferred.resolve(result): resolve the deferred, the result is optional
    deferred.promise(): returns the promise

2.2 In TopicController update the createTopic and getAllTopics invocations to use the promises
    deferred.then(successFn): executes successFn when the operation is successfully done

2.3 (Bonus) If create error handling form createTopic calls.
